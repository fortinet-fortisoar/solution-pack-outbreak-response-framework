# Configuration

## Install and Configure Connectors
For optimal performance of the **Outbreak Response Framework** solution pack, install and configure the following connectors:

- **NIST National Vulnerability Database** - The NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is the U.S. government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). This data enables automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance. The NVD includes databases of security checklist references, security-related software flaws, misconfigurations, product names, and impact metrics. To configure and use the NIST National Vulnerability Database connector, refer to [Configuring NIST National Vulnerability Database](https://docs.fortinet.com/fortisoar/connectors/nist-nvd)

- **Fortinet FortiGuard Outbreak** - Fortinet FortiGuard Outbreak connector receives communication with *FortiGuard Outbreak Alerts* regarding regarding an outbreak and its details. These alerts help understand the technical details of the attack and how organizations can protect themselves from the attack and others like it. To configure and use the Fortinet FortiGuard Outbreak connector, refer to [Configuring Fortinet FortiGuard Outbreak](https://docs.fortinet.com/fortisoar/connectors/fortinet-fortiGuard-outbreak)

- **Fortinet FortiAnalyzer** - FortiAnalyzer is the NOC-SOC security analysis tool built with an operations perspective. FortiAnalyzer (FAZ) supports analytics-powered use cases to provide better detection against breaches. To configure and use the Fortinet FortiAnalyzer connector, refer to [Configuring Fortinet FortiAnalyzer](https://docs.fortinet.com/fortisoar/connectors/fortianalyzer)

- **Fortinet FortiSIEM** - Fortinet FortiSIEM is a highly scalable multi-tenant Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution that provides real-time infrastructure and user awareness for accurate threat detection, analysis, and reporting. To configure and use the Fortinet FortiSIEM connector, refer to [Configuring Fortinet FortiSIEM](https://docs.fortinet.com/fortisoar/connectors/fortisiem)

- **IBM QRadar** - IBM QRadar SIEM helps your business by detecting anomalies, uncovering advanced threats, and removing false positives. It consolidates log events and network flow data from thousands of devices, endpoints, and applications distributed throughout a network. To configure and use the IBM QRadar connector, refer to [Configuring IBM QRadar](https://docs.fortinet.com/fortisoar/connectors/ibm_qradar)


- **Splunk** - Splunk connector allows users to invoke search, fetch events to related search, invoke alert actions, update notables, sync Splunk users to FortiSOAR, etc. To configure and use the Splunk connector, refer to [Configuring Splunk](https://docs.fortinet.com/fortisoar/connectors/splunk_new)

## Setting up Outbreak Response Framework on FortiSOAR

After installation of the **Outbreak Response Framework** solution pack, run the configuration wizard to ready your FortiSOAR environment to investigate Outbreak Alerts. This wizard helps you select and configure **Threat Detection Integrations** on FortiSOAR.

> [!Important]
> After an upgrade, you must run the **Outbreak Response Framework** configuration wizard again.

You can launch the Outbreak Response Framework configuration wizard by any of the following methods:

1. **From navigation menu**
    - Navigate to **Outbreak Management** > **Outbreak Alerts**, if running the wizard for the first time.

        ![Outbreak Response configuration start page](./res/config-wizard-00-b.png)

2. **From Content Hub**
    1. Navigate to **Resources** > **Content Hub**
    2. Search for **Outbreak Response Framework**
    3. Click the *Outbreak Response Framework* card
    4. Click the button **Configure** from the lower-left of the screen.

        ![Outbreak Response start configuration](./res/config-wizard-00.png)        

> [!NOTE]
> The configuration wizard can be **re-launched** only from *Content Hub*.

### Launching the Outbreak Response Framework Configuration Wizard

Click the button **Setup Outbreak Response Framework** on the Outbreak Response Framework configuration page.

![Outbreak Alert get started](./res/config-wizard-01.png)

### Selecting Integrations
    
Select Threat Detection Integration sources to run outbreak response hunt activities and click **Next**.

The hunt activities require searching for adversaries and their tactics, within an environment, against existing information available in the Threat Intel Platform's database (TIP). The Threat Detection Integration sources help run the threat hunt activities and are an important part of the *Outbreak Response Framework*.

![Select Integrations page](./res/config-wizard-02.png)

### Configuring Integrations

Select each integration's tab to configure the associated connector and data ingestion parameters. The page has separate tabs for each integration selected as a threat detection source:

- **Configure the NIST NVD connector**: Refer to [NIST NVD](https://docs.fortinet.com/fortisoar/connectors/nist-nvd) connector documentation for more information.

    ![Configure NIST Integration page](./res/config-wizard-03-nist.png)

- **Configure the Fortinet FortiAnalyzer**: Refer to [NIST NVD](https://docs.fortinet.com/fortisoar/connectors/fortianalyzer) connector documentation for more information.

    You can also configure the Fortinet FortiAnalyzer connector on agent. To run FortiAnalyzer connector actions using an agent, you need the following:

    - **A virtual machine (VM) in the FortiAnalyzer network**: Refer to [recommended specifications](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortisoar/7.6.2/deployment-guide/158469/deploying-fortisoar#Recommended_specifications_for_FSR_agents) and [Prerequisites](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortisoar/7.6.2/deployment-guide/158469/deploying-fortisoar#Prerequisites_for_installing_an_FSR_agent) for installing an agent sections in FortiSOAR product document.

    - **Adding the agent**: Refer to [Adding an agent](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortisoar/7.6.2/deployment-guide/158469/deploying-fortisoar#Adding_an_FSR_agent) on FortiSOAR product documentation.

    - **Installing agent on the VM**: Refer to [Installing an Agent](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortisoar/7.6.2/deployment-guide/158469/deploying-fortisoar#Installing_an_FSR_Agent) on FortiSOAR product documentation.

    - **Installing the Fortinet FortiAnalyzer connector on Agent**: Refer to [Installing a connector on an FSR agent](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortisoar/7.6.2/administration-guide/204303/segmented-network-support#Installing_a_connector_on_an_FSR_agent) on FortiSOAR product documentation.
    
    If the agent is installed and configured, it appears under the Select Configuration drop-down.

    ![Configure Fortinet FortiAnalyzer Integration page](./res/config-wizard-03-faz-1.png)

    Select the default target and configuration to use when Outbreak Management executes the Fortinet FortiAnalyzer connector's actions.
